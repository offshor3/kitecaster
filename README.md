NodeJS App for kitecaster - currently private

This library provides NodeJS with an abstraction to the [Wunderground API](http://http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/) allowing developers to query and integrate Wunderground services into their own applications.

This library nor the authors have any formal relationship with Wunderground other than the  wind we use.
