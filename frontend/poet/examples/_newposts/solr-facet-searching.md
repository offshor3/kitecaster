### Five (5) Simple Facts about Online Shoppers

1. They hate complexity. Keep it simple.
2. When they want it, they want it yesterday. And it better be right 110% of the time.
3. They, like fish, are attracted to bright and shiny objects. (High-Res photos & videos are important).
4. They like standard designs, nice clean - easy to use. (Top bar, side bar, search box required).
5. They expect a great on-site browsing and search experience (thank Google & Apple for that).

While all these items stand out the most from the last 15 years of online marketing and sales, I'm going to focus this article specifically on items #4 and #5.

#### 4. Online Shoppers Like Standard Designs (nice and clean)
A quality trust-worthy website will typically have a standard three bar (or variation of) design. It's not because its trendy or because its even really aesthetically pleasing. 
It has simply just become the standard in web design. It works well at allowing a person to feel "safe" and as we all know, if a personal feels comfortable and safe - their likelihood for purchase increases dramatically.

#### 5. Online Shoppers expect a great browsing experience

##### Understanding your customers
The days of getting by with a landing page and few images coupled with a PayPal buy button are long gone. As are the days of shoppers providing credit cards to less than
certified websites. Today's online shoppers have become pretty savvy.

If you're going to be competitive in this online marketspace, you better have a great design that incorporates the very basics in a fresh new way. Which sounds possibly simple, but
is in actuality horribly complex. I learned at a conference I attended recently that PotteryBarn.com did approximately 250,000 A/B tests in order to find the 'perfect' combination of 
website content, images, and font colors. It's this type of dedication to understanding your clients and users that's important to being successful.

Something that most people often leave out (not intentionally but out of a lack of understanding) is the on-site search experience. Yes, you can integrate Google's hacky attempt - but
who are you trying to kid?

##### On-Site Searching Experience

There are a couple of great solutions on the block these days, my personal favorite is Solr (a wrapper for Apache Lucene) - it's strict in nature but ultimately lightspeed fast. We recently
finished an integration for a client where we built a custom frontend integration into their eCommerce platform. It's industry leading and leaving their customers drooling at the mouth (and it should).
It gives the power and complexity of Google's scale but without the hassles of managing 100 servers, in fact, you can do it in a cluster of 5. Which thanks to Apache's Hadoop architecture for
parrallel processing is very easy to integration (once you pick up the basics anyway).

There is another called elasticsearch, which is also a great and bad solution for different reasons and would need an article by itself to explain why.

The benefits of a filter-style search solution - you can import your entire product list, assign 1000's of attributes to those 
products and allow your end-users to filter based on what they're really seeking. 

##### Reducing time on-site to purchase
What I'm getting at is, there is no reason for your online shopper to search, and then have to paginate
through 5 pages of garbage before they find the product they're after. With the implementation of a filtering search, you can allow them to select the Black Suede Blazer that's a 40 Regular within seconds and be on their way. 
You've effectively taken a shopping experience that was boring and generic and tailored it for your end-user, not to mention reduced their on-site time to purchase time drastically. 
 
### Bringing it all back together ...
So to sum all this up (or cliff notes for those who don't want to read the whole thing)
A standard design wtih a quality filter based search solution can go a long way to increasing customer satisfaction and create a positive impact on your sales.
